Ramirez also stayed in Southern California for college (CSU Fullerton) before the Milwaukee Brewers selected him with a fourth-round pick in the 2011 MLB draft.</p><p>Ramirez was drafted as a first baseman, his position in the minors for the first six years of his career. But the Brewers <a href=# rel=noopener>converted</a> him to a pitcher in 2017, and that enabled him to finally make Triple-A by the end of the season.</p><p>Two years later, he made the bigs (as a member of the Detroit Tigers, after landing there in free agency). He logged his most appearances ever during his 2019 rookie season, going 5-4 with a 4.07 ERA in 46 games.</p><p>Two years later, Ramirez landed with the San Diego Padres on a minor league deal. He signed another minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners in 2022 and spent that season with the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers.</p><p>Another minor league deal in 2023 (this time with the New York Yankees) eventually led to him enjoying a more prolonged stretch in the bigs.</p><p>Ramirez didn't make the big-league club this season, though, and he was eventually designated for assignment before being traded to the Dodgers.</p><p>However, there's a new opportunity waiting for him in Los Angeles, <a href=# rel=noopener>which is in need</a> of relievers due to injury and also more left-handed pitching.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWqAd4OMspino5WawG7A0ZqbnmWcnb1uusicomaqkaK2s7HZZquoZZSksaix0axkoqZdmsWktMCnnp5llqS%2Fbq%2FArJ9mm5%2BjwKqwxKuYraGfo8A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
