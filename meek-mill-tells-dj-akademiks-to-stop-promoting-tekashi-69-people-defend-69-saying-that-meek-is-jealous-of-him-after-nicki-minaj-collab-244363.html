Now, he was promoting some of his new music, and while doing this, he finds himself slammed by Meek Mill.</p><p>Meek tells Akademiks that he should not be promoting his music anymore after he talked to the cops.</p><p>Recently, after the word of Tekashi’s ‘snitching’ got out, people have been slamming him all over social media.</p><p>As we already reported, it seems that Tekashi&nbsp;pleaded guilty to nine federal counts that range from conspiracy, firearm offenses, and narcotics trafficking.</p><p>The Shade Room posted that ‘Since he is pleading guilty, it is likely that he may have struck a deal with the feds to potentially lower his sentencing. He was initially facing life in prison, but this new plea may slightly change his fate.’</p><p>Even<a href=#> 50 Cent posted then deleted a meme</a> featuring Tekashi. Anyway, here’s Akademiks’ post and Meek’s shade:</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BtovI__BY3Q/</p><p>Surprisingly or not, people are defending Tekashi in the comments section. They even say that Meek is just jealous that Nicki Minaj collaborated with&nbsp;69.</p><p>‘This is why Meek will always be a dog to the system. He will be on probation for the rest of his life, in and out of jail. GROW UP MEEK ‼️‼️’ someone posted.</p><p>Another follower said this: ‘Ummm if ppl were plotting to kill me and stole from me, I would be snitching too. IJS. I will be that rat.’</p><p>Someone else believes that Meek is jealous: ‘@meekmill because he was outshining you now he is locked up you can shine and because Nicki loves him.’</p><p>A person wrote that ‘Meek be getting on my nerves lately… Stop talking and just do what you supposed to do.. #free6ix9ine.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think about Meek’s shade?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedmrKsecyio6VlpJq5rb%2BMnaFmmZuWsaa5yKSqZqyfYsC1u89mp6unnaTBqrrGZqueo5Gotap5lXJkqZ2fpbmmecOenZ6mlGKDennSmrCippdiwamt02aknp2bYra0ecmemKWnpah6sLKMoaCmZZGbwaa%2BjKegnKOZYrqqusCjZJynnKGuo3mRbWtsbmNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
