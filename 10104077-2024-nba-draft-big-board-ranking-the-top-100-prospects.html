Tyrese Proctor (Duke, PG/SG, Sophomore)</b></p><p>Size: 6'5", 183 lbs</p><p>Last year's concerns about Proctor's ability to beat defenders and generate rim pressure haven't faded. But he's been significantly more efficient finishing inside the arc, he's flashed clear passing IQ, and despite underwhelming shooting percentages, Proctor has enough shotmaking skill to remain patient with. Still, we can likely forget about the idea of an NBA lead guard. The draw right now to Proctor revolves around his versatility as a guard who can run pick-and-rolls, spot up and generally make good decisions at both ends.</p><p><b>49. Hunter Sallis (Wake Forest, SG, Junior)</b></p><p>Size: 6'5", 185 lbs</p><p>Sallis has looked like a different player with Wake Forest in terms of creation, shotmaking and athletic activity. His game was either put in a straitjacket at Gonzaga, or he made significant improvements during the offseason that have come to life with the increased usage. Sallis has already hit 28 threes after making 16 total through two seasons. He's shot 47.6 percent on pull-ups. He's averaging 18.4 points, converting efficiently from three levels, particular while working on the ball. Sallis' playmaking just remains limited, so a larger, full-season sample size of scoring will make it easier to buy this current breakout.</p><p><b>48. Kobe Johnson (USC, SF, Junior)</b></p><p>Size: 6'6", 200 lbs</p><p>Johnson is snapping out of a cold shooting slump, reviving some hope in his three-point development. It's a key swing skill for a 6'6" wing who's also a high-IQ ball-mover, functional cutter and instinctual wing defender. Johnson checks enough supporting boxes (with translatable strengths) to the point where only a capable catch-and-shoot game may be needed for him to find a role at the next level.</p><p><b>47. Milan Momcilovic (Iowa, SF, Freshman)</b></p><p>Size: 6'8", 210 lbs</p><p>More attention will shift toward Momcilovic after his go-ahead fallaway to beat No. 2 Houston on Tuesday. At 6'8", he's one of the toughest freshmen shotmakers, both from three and inside the arc on specialty jumpers. He may not do much else, but that positional size and shooting for a 19-year-old creates value for a player not likely to go top 20.</p><p><b>46. Trevon Brazile (Arkansas, PF, Sophomore)</b></p><p>Size: 6'10", 220 lbs</p><p>Coming off an ACL year, Brazile's minutes have been down this year, despite Arkansas' having just lost four key rotation players to the 2023 draft. Known for his explosive finishing last season (11 dunks, nine games), he's only picked up three dunks in 14 games this year after the knee injury. He is shooting 40.0 percent from three, and if the athleticism and confidence return to full strength, the ability to spot up and pick up easy buckets at the rim should give him a good chance to earn an NBA role. However, his three-point volume is low, and now there is some guesswork surrounding his recovery and potential lost athleticism.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGl9eIOMa2drbF2jr6J5w6uYn6xdl7aoecGomKucXaeur7fIp55mrJiaerW7z2ZoaWhdpb%2Bwv8%2Bemq2r</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
