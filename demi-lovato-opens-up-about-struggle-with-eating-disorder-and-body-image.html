So I was in that situation — I was just running myself into the ground, and I honestly think that’s kind of what led to everything happening over the past year,” she told Ashley Graham. “It was just me thinking I found recovery when I didn’t and then living this kind of lie, and trying to tell the world that I was happy with myself when I really wasn’t.”</p><p>Following her recovery in 2018, Lovato changed management and is now working with Scooter Braun. Talking about the album she is currently working on, she said “when I realized I wasn’t happy doing that stuff, I made a choice going into this next album. Alright when I present this I’m not going to worry about what I look like. I’m not going to worry about trying to look a certain way or fit a certain mold or whatever. That’s just not who I am. Someone needs to stand up for people who don’t naturally look that way.”</p><p>Watch the full interview on Pretty Big Deal below:</p><p></p><p><strong>Don’t forget to share your thoughts with us in a <a href=#>tweet.</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksaa5yGajqK6Rqbxuu8%2BepaxlpaV6oq7Orqtmq6Snwqizy55ksKGknXqmrdOipaBllJ7AsL7DnqlmmZ6ZeqO7w7JkoqWRnLJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
