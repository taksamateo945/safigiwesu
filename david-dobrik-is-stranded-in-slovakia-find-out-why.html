Everyone went back home because this is taking way longer and it’s a lot harder than I thought it was getting my visa and green card,” <a href=#>he said.</a></p><p><strong>David</strong> was born in Slovakia but moved to the United States when he was 6. He’s also a recipient of DACA, the immigration policy which allows children of undocumented immigrants to live in the US and avoid deportation. They can get approval to leave the country for various reasons, but there is a certain amount of risk because it does not guarantee admission back.</p><p>He previously announced that he had gotten a green card, which would allow him to exit and enter the country freely without the government approval required for DACA recipients.</p><p>“This like a f–king scavenger hunt, so I’m apologizing because I can’t get any vlogs up or anything. I hope to return to the States soon. It’s like I’m lost. I’m literally stranded. Wish me luck,” he said.</p><p>Earlier in the summer, he <a href=#>had a star-studded birthday celebration.</a></p><p></p><p><span>Just Jared on Facebook</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Justjared.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tonJGrtqV5w6iZq6GbYra0edKtqZqmlJqxbrXNZqqlp6aWuKqtjJ%2Bgp5xdpMK1edahsGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
