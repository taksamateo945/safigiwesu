Fans are saying hopefully it does not turn out that she is jinxed for too long.</p><p>It would undoubtedly be a disappointment for many of her supporters to see her going through even more problems with her appearance after struggling through these issues already.</p><p>Tamar wrote: “Ladies pick ya lash girl wisely!! They don’t have NO love for you if u walking around like this!!😫😂😂😂😂😩🙏🏼 #sorrytomylashes”</p><p>The good news is that a few days later, she did post a video showing off perfect hair and eyelash.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B4dB3eAh37J/</p><p>One person said: “That’s why I hate that my girl moved. Finding a good replacement is hard. Every girl I’ve tried had me looking like Tamar too!! It’s a struggle trusting new ppl!!”</p><p>Another commenter shared: “Right!!! Once mine started falling out and looking like parenthesis, I said that’s the last time lol.”</p><p>This backer wrote: “That’s why I don’t fool with that mess. I put individuals on one time, and that sh*t had me looking like a bald eyed Ally cat. Never again…” I use what God gave me for $100, Alex, thanks”.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Tamar has a great sense of humor.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeklrqivoybqZqwpKS7brPErapmoJ%2BjsrTAjJqZqK2kYrSwtc2gZK2nn2Kzor6Mn6arZaSdsm6%2FwKScZqeWYq%2BmrdStsGavmam1brrEsGSpoJ%2BpvG5%2FknJrbm9f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
