There have been lots of debates and polls about whether you’re Team Drizzy (that’s the name for Drake’s fanbase) or Team Eminem, but who’s more popular?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Despite much controversy and disagreement, Eminem is thought to be more popular than Drake. In a </strong><a href=# class=rank-math-link rel=noopener><strong>poll</strong></a><strong>, Eminem won a majority vote over Drake in terms of likeability too with many fans of Eminem saying that his work is more meaningful as it addresses problems aside from money, women, and sex.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You can read more below on a comparison between the two rappers, including who’s richer, who’s more likeable and who has a wider fanbase.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Debate: Eminem Versus Drake</h2><p>When it comes to Eminem and Drake coming head to head in a debate or a poll, there’s normally always one clear winner and that’s Eminem. Eminem is a literal rap God who produces music that’s relatable and meaningful; that’s not to say that Drake doesn’t but this theme that stands out more in Eminem’s music as he produces tracks that are about very contrasting topics from women to politics.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Who’s The Most Famous Rapper?</h3><p>This one’s hardly up for debate, as <a class=rank-math-link href=# rel=noopener>Ranker</a> revealed that Eminem is the most famous rapper in the world while Drake is the fifth most famous.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Social Media Stats</h3><p>Compared with Eminem, Drake has a pretty substantial social media following. For instance, Drake beats Eminem on Instagram followers as he has over 70 million while Eminem has about 40 million less, with just over 30 million followers.</p><p>In addition, Drake also beats Eminem on <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter</a> too, but only by around 10 million followers. Again, on <a href=# rel=noopener>SoundCloud</a>, Drake wins against Drake in terms of followers as he has generated over 2 million followers while Eminem has almost 900,000.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Who Has More Listeners on Spotify?</h3><p>Drake fans will be glad to know that on this one, as it stands at the time of writing in 2020, Drake has more monthly listeners than Eminem. Per month Drake has <a href=# rel=noopener>59.8 million</a> listeners while Eminem has <a href=# rel=noopener>38.9 million</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Who’s a Better Rapper?</h3><p>What makes a rapper’s music good is highly contested and has never really been agreed upon, but many people including writers from Stop The Breaks indicate that “a great rapper has to have a good balance of the following categories: body of work, impact, commercial success, storytelling, songwriting, longevity, live performance and rhyme skills.”</p><p>One thing that both rappers have in common is that they’ve both had a lot of commercial success, they’ve been on the rap scene for quite a long time and they’ve definitely got some skills because if they didn’t then they probably wouldn’t be famous at all.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>This poll deemed that Eminem is the better rapper with a 78% majority in favor of Eminem and a 22% minority in favor of Drake.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the responses to the poll, fans describe Eminem as the “best rapper of all time” since he has been rapping since a young age whereas Drake only entered the rap scene after his appearance in Degrassi: The Next Generation making his breakthrough by 2006, at which point he was 30 years old.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Who’s Richer?</h3><p>Eminem beats Drake on this one too. And while your earnings aren’t normally a measure of your success, in the music industry it’s a bit different, so from a singer’s earnings you can usually make assumptions about their success.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>The gap in net worth between Drake and Eminem is quite slim when taken at face value, because as of 2020, Eminem is worth around $60k more than Drake, with a <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of $210 million compared to Drake’s <a href=# rel=noopener>$150 million</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jp2pmqOVYsO0ecSmoKednWLEqbvSZqSoqpVivbC81KWYq2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
