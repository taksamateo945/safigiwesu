Eighty-five percent of what y’all up here talking to me about happened after I married that girl right there,” said the “Family Feud” host as he pointed to his wife seated in the audience.</p><p>“We been 18 years strong. I don’t know what y’all been trying to do, but we covered though,” said the “You Got Served” actor, seemingly giving subtle acknowledgment to the speculation about his marriage. Since August, the mother of three has been at the center of hearsay claims that she <a href=#>cheated on the comedian</a> with a bodyguard and a chef.</p><p>Steve previously has <a href=#>shut down what he says are false narratives</a> and stated that his union was well intact.
