Ms. Juicy was a staple voice on “The Rickey Smiley Show” for more than a decade, even before her “Little Women: Atlanta” fame. She left the show, sparking rumors that she was fired, which she emphatically denies.</p><p>“I left the morning show because I’d been there 13 years and I wanted to move on to something bigger and better,” Ms. Juicy explained.&nbsp;The bigger and better for Ms. Juicy includes a co-hosting gig on ReecRadio, and a new acting project coming up with Lifetime that she was tightlipped about but excited for.&nbsp;She’s also venturing into the fashion industry “I launched my eyeglass wear Eminence Eyewear by Juicy,” she said. “I’m never not working.&nbsp;I’m constantly keeping busy and continue to build my empire.”</p><p>Monie has her eye set on being an actor and has been taking acting lessons to help sharpen her skills.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms. Juicy also became an executive producer on “Little Women: Atlanta.”&nbsp;“I just try to lead by example,” Ms. Juicy said.&nbsp;“This season, by me becoming executive producer, it was important to show them that we are young Black women.&nbsp;We are young women.&nbsp;We are in charge.&nbsp;We are bosses,” she said. She added a round of praise for her cast mates.</p><p>“I got to commend each and every one of the girls for their confidence and their mentality of not quitting. For not giving up,” she said. “There are so many times where all of us have episodes where we wanted to throw in the towel and each of the girls did not.&nbsp;They found something within and they pulled it out,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ye49sZmpqX6yybsPAp6uenF2pvG7Ax6umsGWZo3q1tMRmq6ivlaF6rr%2BMo6yim6lirq%2BwjKamp6GVYrynecuiq62klWLEsLnEp2SarJyWu7WtjK2YpaNdora0r86nmp6opJ68r7%2BMmqWdZZ6axG67z6mmq6ylo7a1tcSsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
