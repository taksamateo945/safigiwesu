The singer, who suffers from lupus, was given a second chance at life when her friend and fellow actress, Francia Raisa donated her own of her kidneys.</p><p>Naturally, she was very grateful and happy that she was going to live because of this procedure, but at the same time, she could not help but feel a little upset and insecure about how her body had changed.</p><p>More precisely, now the singer and actress has a pretty big scar that runs from her lower abdomen to her upper inner thigh!</p><p>But Selena has come a long way since and now, she says it makes her feel like a ‘warrior!’</p><p>Selena shared during her interview with People that: ‘At the beginning of my recovery, I was a bit sad. You are already going through something, and then there is the added pressure of ‘I do not look the same. I do not know if I feel comfortable in my own body. But I am also around some of the best people, who see beyond things we sometimes get wrapped up in. I would not be here if it was not for that scar, and now I look at it in a much different way. I now feel like I’m more of a warrior.’</p><p>Furthermore, in a previous post that showed her in a bathing suit, she recalled that ‘When I got my kidney transplant, I still remember it being really difficult at first showing my scar. I did not want it to be in photos, so I wore things that would cover it up. Now, however, more than ever, I feel confident in who I am and what I went through…and I am proud of that.</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p>A post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez)</p><p>Aside from her lupus battle and her surgery, Selena has also been open about her mental health, sharing her struggle with anxiety and depression.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>As it seems, the star is so transparent because she wants to bring awareness to such widely spread problems and also be a great role model for her younger fans.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejmrmmusBmnqilla%2FAbsDRmqWsqJyWu7V50pyYq2Wdlrimv4yhnKtllpqyrXnLoqKeZZFixKK%2B0aKmq2WYmr%2Bmv4ywn7JlZGt9eIGWaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
