He inspired a lot of back people in South Africa to come out and live their best lives through his rugby games. He gave people hope and was backed up by popular figures such as Mandela. This has seen a lot of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tribute</a> flowing in after his demise. Here are some that are worth a mention:</p><p class=align-left>Alexander said,</p>The news of Chester’s passing is devastating and hard to believe, as he was still young and seemingly in good health. Chester was a true pioneer in SA rugby and his performances at the World Cup in 1995, as a snapshot of his Springbok career, will forever be etched in the hearts and minds of our rugby public. He was passionate about rugby and SA and, as coach at various levels, selflessly gave back to the game after he'd hung up his boots. He played with courage and was a beacon of light in his community and in the broader SA context. Chester Williams had so much more to give. Our thoughts and condolences are with his wife, Maria, and his children, family and friends during this very sad time.<p class=align-left>Kevin Luiters, the current Eastern Province Elephants scrum-half said,</p>This man had so much substance, it is difficult to comprehend. What a great human being, what a great friend, what a great father, what a great human, what a great coach. Chester Williams will forever be remembered and his praises will forever be sung. The love that he had for the game, the love that he had for the fans – his character spoke volumes. His praises are still sung high in Romania, where he is adored among the people and rugby fraternity.<p class=align-left>Wiese said,</p>Chester was a very talented player whom I got to know a little after my brother played in the Western Province League Craven Week team in the late 1980s. Chester didn’t talk much on the field, but he was very passionate about his team and his teammates. He loved the game of rugby dearly and he had the respect of the community for what he achieved.He was a very important part of our 1995 team. We all understood the symbolic nature of Chester’s inclusion in the team but as a squad we never made a big thing about it, and neither did he. He was one of the team and he never wanted to be singled out. We had a vision and a goal and desperately wanted to win the tournament, and Chester was a big part of us doing that.<p class=align-left>The main man himself, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cyril Ramaphosa</a>, also paid his tribute. He said:</p>Chester Williams’s death at this tender age leaves all South Africans bereft of a rugby hero and national role model who still had a great deal to offer his sport and his country. We will miss the humility and joy of life with which Chester conducted himself during an illustrious career that inspired hundreds of thousands of South African children who had previously been excluded from rugby, to take up the game. We salute him for the extraordinary achievements he recorded in a life that has sadly ended prematurely.<h2>Memorial service and funeral dates</h2><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">memorial service and funeral dates</a> of the celebrated rugby player and coach has been confirmed. His memorial service will be held on Wednesday, September 11th at the University of the Western Cape (UWC) in Cape Town. The service is scheduled to begin at 13:00 in the main hall located inside the campus. A formal funeral service will be conducted on Saturday, September 14.</p><p class=align-left>Chester Mornay Williams, a.k.a The Black Pearl has finally rested. He served his country well and fulfilled his purpose. Like great South Africans, Chester Williams will be preserved in time through art and legends. He came, he saw, and he conquered. South Africans will forever say that he was here. He loved, he lived, and he served. Rest well Chester, rest in power legend.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>:</p><ul><li>Mduduzi Mabaso biography: age, son, ex-wife, wife, Rhythm City, movies, nominations, awards, and net worth</li><li>Teko Modise biography: age, measurements, wife, business, current team, stats, salary, cars, house, Instagram and net worth</li><li>Shoki Sebotsane biography: age, weight loss, children, husband, ex husband, pictures, Skeem Saam, nominations and Instagram</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfHSClmtwZpuYmsC1sdFmrqKknJ6urr%2BMnq2eqqmptaq6xmajmqyVYsCxvsinnpunm2K5prPEp5tnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
