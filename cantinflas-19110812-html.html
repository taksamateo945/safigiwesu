He is considered to have been the most widely-accomplished Mexican comedian and is celebrated throughout Latin America and in Spain as a popular icon. His humor, loaded with Mexican linguistic features of intonation, vocabulary, and syntax, is beloved in all the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America and in Spain and has given rise to a range of expressions including cantinflear, cantinflada, cantinflesco, and cantinflero. Though some of his films were translated into English and French, the wordplay was so particular to Mexican Spanish that it was difficult to translate. He often portrayed impoverished farmers or a peasant of pelado origin. The character allowed Cantinflas to establish a long, successful film career that included a foray into Hollywood.</p><table class=wikibox readability=13.5><tr readability=7><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Mario Fortino Alfonso Moreno Reyes, August 12, 1911, Santa María la Redonda, Mexico City, Mexico</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>April 20, 1993, Mexico City, Mexico</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Burial place</td><td class=wk_value>Panteón Español, Mexico City, Mexico</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Nationality</td><td class=wk_value>Mexican</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Other names</td><td class=wk_value>Mario Moreno</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Citizenship</td><td class=wk_value>Mexican</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Education</td><td class=wk_value>Instituto Politecnico Nacional Chapingo Autonomous University (Agronomy, few months)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Comedian, actor, screenwriter, film producer, singer</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1936–1984</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Political party</td><td class=wk_value>Institutional Revolutionary Party</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>Mario Arturo Moreno</td></tr></table><p>Movie Actor Cantinflas was born on August 12, 1911 in Mexico City, Mexico (He dies at the age of 81, on April 20, 1993).</p><p>Mario Moreno, regarded as the "<a href=# title="Charlie Chaplin biography">Movie Actor Charlie Chaplin</a> of Mexico", was a Mexican comedic performer, producer, and playwright.
