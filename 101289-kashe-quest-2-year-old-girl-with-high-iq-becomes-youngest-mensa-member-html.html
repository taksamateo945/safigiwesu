She, for instance, loves watching the movie <i>Frozen</i> and has memorised all the songs.</p>“Kashe loves playing make-believe with her friends,” Athwal added.<p class=align-left>It is against this backdrop that the parents decided to let her go through normal schooling like her peers so that she is not made to feel pressure to grow up too fast.</p><p class=align-left>The executive director of American Mensa, Trevor Mitchell, described Quest as remarkable, adding that it's good her abilities have been recognised early in life.</p>“Her parents will be able to help her with some of the unique challenges gifted youth encounter. Being the smartest person in the room isn't always easy and Mensa understands the importance of being challenged by others, of having our potential recognised, and of celebrating achievements,” he told TODAY.<p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: Never miss breaking news – join Briefly News' <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Telegram channel</a></strong></p><p class=align-left>An eight-year-old genius is trending on social media for her incredible coding skills.
