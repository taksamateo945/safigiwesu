Tony Khan, the promotion's CEO, <a href=# rel=noopener>addressed the situation</a> on the most recent edition of Collision and was asked again about Punk following All Out on Sunday.</p><p>In particular, Khan was pressed about whether the former world champion has any sort of non-compete clause tied to his departure.</p><p>"I don't want to discuss the terms of the separation, in that sense," he <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a>. "I think it's best to say‚Äîfirst of all, I very much want to thank CM Punk, Phil, for everything he did for AEW as a wrestler.</p><p>"But, I don't think it was an easy decision for anybody on the discipline committee or for the outside counsel or for me to do something like that. But I do think it was the right move, and as far as what's going to happen in the future, I can't speak to that. I'm not the attorneys who interpret all that language."</p><p>The comments will do little to cool the speculation of CM Punk's <a href=# rel=noopener>possible return</a> to WWE‚Äîno matter how unlikely‚Äînow that the door is firmly closed on AEW.</p><p><b>Christian Cage Sidesteps Question about Edge in AEW; Reveals New Contract</b></p><p>Edge is another wrestling legend bound for free agency with his WWE contract <a href=#>due to expire</a>. AEW would be a natural landing spot if the Rated-R Superstar wants to continue his career elsewhere.</p><p>Don't ask his former tag team partner about this possibility, though. Christian Cage had a succinct response after All Out when discussing the likelihood of Edge joining him in the company.</p>Melissa üåàü´∂üèª <span class=acct>@melissax1125</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hausman asked Christian about Edge possibly joining AEW.. "I only talk about myself.. and Luchasaurus. I have no friends besides Luchasaurus, and I'll leave it at that" üíÄ</p><p>The 49-year-old did at least confirm he signed a "big fat contract" to extend his stay in AEW.</p>Drainmaker üåßÔ∏è üíµ <span class=acct>@DrainBamager</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Christian Cage on his doubters, and reveals that Tony Khan and AEW have just re-signed him with a BIG FAT CONTRACT. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7CMJIrTsCo">pic.twitter.com/7CMJIrTsCo&lt;/a></p><p>Edge and Christian have both been excellent individually in their current roles, and a reunion has the potential to deliver some magic should it come to fruition.</p><p><b>Jack Perry Serving an Indefinite Suspension</b></p><p>Punk isn't the only party who suffered consequences in connection to the All In incident. Khan <a href=# rel=noopener>confirmed</a> Jack Perry received an indefinite suspension and has been absent backstage since the show in London.</p><p>There were <a href=# rel=noopener>reports</a> that both Punk and Perry were suspended in the immediate aftermath of their physical altercation.</p><p>Based on Khan's comments, it's unclear when Perry will be back in an AEW ring, and that uncertainty is less than ideal for the 26-year-old when he has found his footing as a singles heel. Even in a losing effort to Hook at All In, he continued to impress.</p>All Elite Wrestling <span class=acct>@AEW</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Channeling his inner &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TherealRVD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TherealRVD&lt;/a>, Jack Perry hits ROLLING THUNDER on a limo!&lt;br>&lt;br>Order &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AEWAllIn?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AEWAllIn&lt;/a> LIVE on PPV right now!&lt;br>üá∫üá∏: &lt;a href="https://t.co/mUn4tim61a">https://t.co/mUn4tim61a&lt;/a>&lt;br>üîó &lt;a href="https://t.co/p1Cr3Sb7zg">https://t.co/p1Cr3Sb7zg&lt;/a>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boy_myth_legend?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@boy_myth_legend&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/730hook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@730Hook&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/mAakb5l8KU">pic.twitter.com/mAakb5l8KU&lt;/a></p><p>In a way, though, all of this drama might work to Perry's benefit because he's bound to generate a massive reaction the first time he shows back up on AEW programming.</p><p><i>Listen to Ring Rust Radio for all of the hot wrestling topics.
