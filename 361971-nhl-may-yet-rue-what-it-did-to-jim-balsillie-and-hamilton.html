Over 10,000 fans are said to have pledged to buy season tickets.</p><p>But no credible investors have stepped forward and no concrete action has been taken to build a new arena.&nbsp; Talk has died away.</p><p>There remains Quebec.&nbsp; From October to December there was a flurry of concrete activity.</p><p>Quebecor, a first class investor that was unsuccessful in buying the Montreal Canadians agreed to front a bid to get the Nordiques back.&nbsp; Then the mayor, Regis Lebeaume met with Bettman who probably gave him an unofficial promise of a returned team if a proper NHL-size arena is built.</p><p>The mayor subsequently announced the city would pledge $50 million towards a new arena, said to cost $400 million, and called on the Provincial and Federal Governments to split the remaining $350 million cost between them.</p><p>Finally he announced that he was hiring an engineering firm to conduct a $4 million feasibility survey to determine if the Nordiques can be revived and solvent for the long term with a new arena.</p><p>Then maddening silence.</p><p>The use of public money to fund a facility that is essentially for a private sports enterprise will not go down well with the rest of Quebec and Canada, given the record of untrustworthy sports franchise owners.</p><p>The mayor has also said that the new arena is also part of a future Winter Olympic bid so that the rest of the province and the country will get behind it and approve the funds.</p><p>Not many people are buying it.&nbsp; If Federal money were used, it would provoke outrage and possible political repercussions, certainly in Manitoba, which got little Federal funding for its too-small arena and new CFL stadium.</p><p>Canadians are willing to spend public funds on international sports events like the Olympics and the Pan Am Games, but not for arenas for a league that many see as anti-Canadian.</p><p>The solution is to acquire more private funding.&nbsp; That is how the current arenas in Montreal and Toronto were built.&nbsp; But during the long silence there has not been any announcements of new investors joining Quebecor in its bid or to build a new arena.</p><p>If Quebec had enough funds, there would no need for a feasibility study.&nbsp; Talk would be about where to start building.</p><p>Then on March 12, it was reported that Quebecor's efforts to bring the Nordiques back was on track, praised the fact that a survey was being conducted, but gave no information about when it would be completed.</p><p>Marcel Aubut, the former president of the Nordiques said that the project remains a long-term one.</p><p>That's a far cry from what the mayor wanted when he hoped that a new arena would be built by 2012.</p><p>All this proves is that Jim Balsillie was right.&nbsp; That Hamilton, Ontario is the best place to put a relocated or expansion NHL team in North America.</p><p>They have a first class arena that currently is the same size as some of the smaller NHL arenas that can be expanded to over the NHL median of 18,000.&nbsp; Luxury boxes can be expanded to 200.</p><p>They have a wealthy market of several million people stretching from Niagara Falls to Owen Sound and from Mississauga to London.</p><p>It has been speculated that a Hamilton franchise could be the third most valuable in the NHL, behind only the Leafs and Rangers.&nbsp; No wonder Balsillie wanted a team.</p><p>And its obvious why Toronto and Buffalo want to keep Hamilton out.&nbsp; They want the rich southern Ontario market all to themselves.</p><p>Politics, not lack of fan support, nor a bad sports arena, nor lack of credible investors is depriving Hamilton of top level professional hockey.</p><p>Hamilton should have had a team nearly 20 years ago when chief investor Tim Doughnut fumbled away the city's chances and Ottawa got the promised expansion team instead.</p><p>Since then, the NHL has ignored Hamilton and pretended that it was minor league despite it hosting major events like the Briar, the Canada Cup, and the World Junior Hockey Championship successfully.</p><p>Meanwhile the NHL continues to lose huge sums of money in Phoenix and other franchises like Florida, Atlanta, Nashville, and the Islanders are said to be vulnerable too.</p><p>No credible owner has stepped forward to bail them out except the questionable Ice Edge bid.</p><p>The NHL may have got rid of Balsillie but it did not solve its franchise problems.&nbsp;</p><p>Hamilton could solve one of them right away, but the NHL likes to pretend that it is located on the moon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoam9paWx%2BbrrHpWSmmalixqbAjKusnmWnna61ecitZJ2hlGLBsHnJoqRmmpGhwKq4y6KcZpmemXqprcyio62nng%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
