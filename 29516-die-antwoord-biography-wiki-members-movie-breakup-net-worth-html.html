What does it mean <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">to be Zef</a>? Zef refers to a counterculture interest group. In their Zef music, the duo combines different cultures. Zef is, therefore, an amalgamation of modern music and outdated culture. In this movement, one looks stylish, fancy and sexy even if they are not wealthy in reality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/b29a4fe1a11d4a88.jpg><h2>Career path</h2><p class=align-left>2009 was the year that Ninja and Yolandi began their musical journey after the release of the first album $O$ that was availed free online. The single Enter the Ninja made the album a success. The video of the song was on YouTube for nine months before it became famous.

There is a characteristic interplay in their Zef Songs between Ninja’s swagger and the high-pitched parts by Yolandi.</p><p class=align-left>The uniqueness of the group’s art has incited curiosity. On several occasions, American journalists questioned whether their art was a hoax. Ninja asserted that he was not playing any character and that he is a superman who does not remove his suit. He further said that Antwoord’s music is a shock machine that wakes up the sleeping people. The duo’s music is futuristic and exciting, and the lyrics are usually in Afrikaans, English and Xhosa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/df93affbaae0c9de.jpg><h2>Die Antwoord last album</h2><p class=align-left>At the beginning of 2017, the duo announced that it would be releasing the fifth and final studio album.
