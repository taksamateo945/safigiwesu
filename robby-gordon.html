Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Robby Gordon celebrates birthday on January 2 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In the 2001 New Hampshire 300 the race was postponed due to the 9/11 attacks and Jeff Gordon clinched the 2001 Cup championship the previous week at Atlanta. The race was held around Thanksgiving in 2001 and Gordon driving the No. 31 Richard Childress Racing car, after Mike Skinner chose to retire from RCR after he was nearly killed in a crash at a previous race, won his first race in the Cup series after an incident with Jeff Gordon: with 16 laps to go Jeff was leading and hoping to make his points lead bigger in his inevitable margin against Tony Stewart by winning the race but Robby in the No. 31 drove up to second place and made slight contact, getting Jeff Gordon loose, and therefore giving Robby the lead. Jeff was angered and rushed up to Robby under caution and retaliated by trying to cut down Robby’s tire but was black-flagged before he could make a second attempt to get to the No. 31’s tire. Jeff served a one lap penalty, still won the championship and managed to race in the middle of the pack. Jeff would eventually work his way back up to a 15th-place finish. Robby on the final restart pulled away from Sterling Marlin and won his first cup race and first victory on an oval in the NASCAR Cup series. This win gave Robby the No. 31 RCR car for a multi-year deal after 2001. Jeff when interviewed maintained that he should have not been penalized and publicly retorted to Robby that he should have been embarrassed to have won in the way that the finish was; Robby said in reply that he Jeff “should be embarrassed for retaliating like he did.” Robby then promised to donate all his winning money by division to the 9/11 victims’ relatives.
