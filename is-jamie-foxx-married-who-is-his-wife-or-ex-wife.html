Who is His Wife or Ex-Wife?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Jamie Foxx is not married; however, he’s been in three failed relationships with Katie Holmes, Connie Kline, and Kristin Grannis.</strong></p><p>Additionally, Jamie has two daughters: Corrine Foxx, and Annalise Bishop from his previous relationships. Despite being in several relationships, the Oscar Award winner has never been married and doesn’t seem to have plans to get married anytime soon. Similarly, the veteran actor has never proposed to any of his girlfriends before.</p><h2><b>Who Is Jamie Foxx Dating Now?</b></h2><p>Jamie Foxx is currently dating a model called Dana Caprio. The pair started dating a few months after Jamie broke up with Katie. According to InTouch Weekly, the couple met through mutual friends. They were first spotted together on a date at Mr. Chow in Beverly Hills.</p><p>Jamie’s love for Dana became even more confirmed after the actor started liking Dana’s (mostly bikini-clad) photos on <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> in July 2019. Moreover, Dana’s is one of the few accounts the American actor follows, though he has 9 million followers of his own.</p><h3><b>Jamie Foxx’s Girlfriend, Dana Caprio, Works At a Restaurant</b></h3><p>Dana Caprio is said to be<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> a server at Sur</a>, a popular restaurant located at the heart of the Vanderpump Rules drama on Bravo. In addition, she’s signed to Wilhelmina Models in New York City and is a boxing studio coordinator and fitness model to boot.</p><p>In October of 2019, Dana reportedly featured in <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Jamie’s IG stories</a> amongst a friend group headed off to a lovely Halloween bash where her lover performed alongside Snoop Dogg and Busta Rhymes.</p><p>However, Jamie and Dana’s romance isn’t as noticeable as it was in the first stage of their relationship. Neither appears to post or talk much about their dating life in the media. So the pair may be either no longer romantically together, or maybe they just prefer to keep matters private — one cannot easily tell!</p><h2><b>Did Jamie Foxx Date Sela Vave?</b></h2><p>Even though Jamie and Sela were pretty close, they never dated. Officially, the duo never called themselves a couple, even when it seems they’re in love. However, the pair certainly <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">shared a close bond</a>, when Jamie was acting as her mentor in the music industry.</p><p>Jamie and Sela reportedly toured Disneyland and the Hamptons as a pair, as seen in some of the photos Sela shared on her Instagram page in June 2019. Apparently, Jamie had already split from Katie for nearly three months when they started appearing in places together.</p><h2><b>Are Jamie Foxx And Katie Holmes Still Together?</b></h2><p>Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes were together in a romantic relationship from 2013 through 2019. Katie Holmes (born&nbsp; December 18, 1978, in Toledo, OH), started dating Jamie in May 2013, in a relationship that was kept private and from media attention.</p><p>They would, however, eventually break up in 2019 after six years together. The reason for their shocking split is still unknown to the public. However, news of their split came only days after the Just Mercy star was spotted with singer Sela Vave. At the time of their breakup, an insider exclusively disclosed to US Weekly that Katie was the one to pull the plug on their relationship.</p><p>Before Jamie, Holmes was married to American superstar actor, Tom Cruise. However, Katie and Cruise got divorced after spending seven years together in marriage. Holmes, meanwhile, has moved on and is now dating American musician Bobby Wooten III. In April 2022, the pair were seen kissing and holding hands during a New York City outing. Bobby was also captured hugging Katie’s mother, Kathy Holmes, at a fun day in Central Park.</p><h2><b>Jamie Foxx Was Seen Loved-up With a “Mystery” Woman&nbsp;</b></h2><p>In Southern France, the actor was spotted snuggling up to an unidentified youthful hot woman on a yacht. The two appeared to exchange kisses on the poolside aboard the boat, and Jamie’s date was captured a few hours later holding onto him tightly as they cruise a spin on a spurt ski.</p><p>Jamie appeared in a white t-shirt, flier sunglasses, and flat-brim cap enjoying the spin, while his lady companion wore a red bikini top and black syncope films.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/ezgif.com-gif-maker-1.jpg alt="Jamie Foxx Married" width=2000 height=1333 sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The Dreamgirls star was in the South of France to attend the Cannes Film Festival.

In one of the videotapes, which Foxx tagged “#daddydaughtertime,” the actor captured Corinne, showing off some cotillion moves while having some regale out at an eatery.</p><h2><b>How Many Baby Mamas Does Jamie Foxx Have?</b></h2><p>Jamie Foxx has two baby mamas, namely Kristin Grannis, and Connie Kline. Both have produced two wonderful daughters named Corinne Foxx and Annalise Bishop for him.</p><p>Corinne Foxx, Jamie’s first daughter, was birthed in 1994 by Kristen Grannis. Corinne, who is seemingly following in her father’s footsteps, has won an Emmy for outstanding variety special for her roles in ABC’s “Live in Front of a Studio Audience: All in the Family” and “Good Times.” She’s also recognized for her role as Sasha in “47 Meters Down Uncaged”, in the series “Dollface.”</p><p>Since 2018, she’s been appearing alongside her father on the game show, “Beat Shazam,” as the DJ. The young talented actress has a strong bond with her father, even though he is no longer in love with her mother.</p><p>On the other hand, Jamie Foxx’s second daughter, Annalise Bishop, who was born in 2006 hasn’t started her professional career yet. Notwithstanding, she’s appeared in several red-carpet events alongside her dad, such as <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">the 2015 Grammys</a> and the 2021 SAG Awards.
