Now, a German court has given him a 14-month suspended sentence and fine of about $300,000 for the arsenal, which was seized in a raid in 2015.</p><p>While it takes some effort for German citizens to legally buy and carry loaded firearms, it’s entirely prohibited to own any weapons of war. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Insider</a>, the man violated the Weapons Control Act by possessing military-grade weapons. His lawyers, however, argued that because most of his collection was non-functioning, he could not be charged.</p><p>The man, identified in court documents as Klaus-Dieter F. from Heikendorf, had also amassed a torpedo, 70 rifles and machine guns, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and an unspecified number of semi and fully automatic pistols.</p><p>German authorities were initially alerted to the hoard in 2005 when a home inspection revealed much of the collection. But a debate about legality and licenses stalled any action for a decade.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-338936 alt="Heikendorf Residents And Panther Tank" width=900 height=582 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heikendorf-residents-and-panther-tank.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-338936 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Carsten Rehder/Picture Alliance/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Residents of Heikendorf watch the tank being removed from the retiree’s property.</span></p><p>It wasn’t until 2015 that an investigation into stolen Nazi art led to a raid on Klaus-Dieter F.’s house that ended in the <a href=# rel=noopener>seizure</a> of thousands of pieces of Nazi weapons and artifacts.</p><p>In addition to the weaponry, investigators discovered a hoard of Nazi memorabilia, including a bust of Adolf Hitler, mannequins with Nazi uniforms, swastika pendants, and lamps shaded with the rune symbols of the SS (or “Schutzstaffel”), Nazi Germany’s paramilitary squadron.</p><p>Officials also encountered a statue of a naked warrior wielding a sword, which was made by Hitler’s favorite sculptor Arno Breker and formerly stood outside Hitler’s Berlin chancellery.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel=noopener>BBC</a>, it took 20 German soldiers nine hours to remove the tank from the basement.
