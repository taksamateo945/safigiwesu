The team fell to the Kansas Jayhawks 72-69 in the title game.</p><p>North Carolina put together an inconsistent 2022-23 season, finishing with a 20-13 record and missing out on the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2009-10, marking the first time a preseason No. 1 failed to secure a spot in the tournament since the field expanded in 1985.</p><p>After falling to the Virginia Cavaliers in the ACC tournament quarterfinals, Love announced his decision to enter the transfer portal. He then revealed in April his <a href=# rel=noopener>commitment</a> to Michigan, but ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Jeff Borzello</a> reported May 17 that he had decommitted from the program.</p><p>Borzello added that "there was an admissions issue related to credits transferring."</p><p>It's no surprise Love decided to commit to Arizona. <a href=# rel=noopener>Eric Bossi</a> of 247Sports reported May 24 that the Wildcats were among the schools "that keep coming up in conversations with sources around Love."</p><p>"Texas seems to have been involved the longest while Arizona was right on their heels," Bossi wrote. "Gonzaga emerged a bit over the course of the weekend."</p><p>Love will join a roster in Arizona that is coached by Tommy Lloyd and includes Kylan Boswell, Filip Borovicanin, Tautvilas Tubelis, Oumar Ballo, Pelle Larsson, Henri Veesaar, Dylan Anderson and KJ Lewis.</p><p>He has two seasons of eligibility remaining, as all student-athletes who were part of a program in 2020 were awarded an extra year of eligibility due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The Wildcats finished the 2022-23 season second in the Pac-12 with a 28-7 record.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ2x%2Ben6Mn6arpZWnera6wmaqrZmiYrCiuMSbZKWnppp6tb7Ap6qfnaKoerW7jJqporKfo65urcWtnKtllJqwsLnMoqutoZ6ceqe%2BzqZkpqGTnbaorc0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
