Taylor is an actress who is best known for her role as Marcia Brady in the Brady Bunch flicks.</p><p>Following their separation, Stiller left the family home, though he moved back in during the&nbsp;<a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Covid</a> pandemic to be closer to their kids; Ella Stiller, 19, and Quinlin Stiller, 16.</p><h2>Ben Stiller Wife Christine Taylor: Are They still together?</h2><p>The comedian has opened up about the impact of moving back into the family home in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Esquire</a>, confirming that it ultimately helped rekindle his marriage.</p><p>He told the outlet that as the pandemic began, moving back into the family home was considered the only way that he could see his children during the initial months of lockdown.</p><p>It however “unexpectedly” benefited his marriage, with Stiller revealing during the recent interview that he and Taylor are now back together as a couple.</p><p>Discussing moving back into the family home, he said that “over the course of time” the estranged former couple got closer, with him adding that “it evolved.”</p><p>He said: “We were separated and got back together. We’re happy about that. It’s been really wonderful for all of us.”</p><p>The Meet the Parents stars described their experience as “unexpected” but noted that it had been one of the positive things to come out of the global pandemic</p><p>Stiller said that they now have “respect” for both their similarities and differences, adding: “I think accepting that, you can really appreciate someone more because you’re not trying to get them to change for you.”</p><h2>Children Ella Olivia Stiller</h2><p>It turns out, Ella’s passion for acting started at a young age. Ben recalled her appearing in<i>&nbsp;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</i> while in the fourth grade, and how supportive Jerry was of his granddaughter.</p><p>“I said, ‘Dad, what’d you think?’ And he said, ‘I didn’t care for it, I didn’t care for it,’” Ben said during an interview with<b>&nbsp;Jimmy Fallon</b>. “I said, ‘What are you talking about?’ He goes, ‘Ella was amazing. Ella had the commitment, and she was shining up there, but I didn’t feel the rest of the kids were up to it. And he wasn’t kidding!”</p><p>It is unclear if Ella attends a university, but Ben previously told&nbsp;<b>Ellen DeGeneres&nbsp;</b>that she was likely to attend some sort of acting school. However, she’s already started building her&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>resume</a>&nbsp;and has appeared in&nbsp;<i>Hubie Halloween</i>,&nbsp;<i>Fork Knife and Chainsaw</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Escape at Dannemora</i>.</p><h2>Children Quinlin Dempsey Stiller</h2><p>Ben and Christine’s youngest child is growing up to look more like his famous father every day. Considering he’s just a teen, time will tell if he decides to also pursue a career in entertainment. He already has a bit of experience and first appeared in&nbsp;<i>Madagascar 2</i>&nbsp;when he was just a toddler.</p><p>“He got in there, and he got in front of the microphone, and there was like a run of like a minute where he just had fun and he was making sounds, and we were saying, ‘Oh, be happy, happy and sad,’” Ben recalled to <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Chicago Parent</i></a>&nbsp;about Quinlin, who was just 3 at the time, doing voice work for the film. “And then he started to get a little bit intimidated by the microphone and the whole thing. And then that’s when you start to feel, like, this horrible stage parent saying, ‘Laugh, cry, cry.’”</p><p>The actor continued, “It’s interesting because you realize that if your kids aren’t that comfortable with that situation you don’t wanna force them to do it. I was happy that they weren’t getting up there and going all Shirley Temple or something.”</p><h2>What is Ben Stiller’s net worth?</h2><table id=tablepress-385 class="tablepress tablepress-id-385"><tr class="row-1 odd"><th class=column-1>Net Worth:</th><th class=column-2>$200 Million</th></tr><tbody class=row-hover><tr class="row-2 even"><td class=column-1>Age:</td><td class=column-2>55</td></tr><tr class="row-3 odd"><td class=column-1>Born:</td><td class=column-2>November 30, 1965</td></tr><tr class="row-4 even"><td class=column-1>Country of Origin:</td><td class=column-2>United States of America</td></tr><tr class="row-5 odd"><td class=column-1>Source of Wealth:</td><td class=column-2>Professional Actor</td></tr><tr class="row-6 even"><td class=column-1>Last Updated:</td><td class=column-2>2021</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As of 2022, Ben Stiller’s net worth is roughly $200 million.</p><h2 id=insight-into-ben-stiller-wikipedia>Insight Into Ben Stiller Wikipedia</h2><p>Ben Stiller has already been mentioned by the mainstream&nbsp;<a href=#>Wikipedia</a>&nbsp;page with a brief biography.</p><p>Stiller is a member of the so-called Frat Pack, a collection of humorous performers.
