She was born on February 20, 1988 in Saint Michael, Barbados. Her given name is actually Robyn Rihanna Fenty. Her mother was an accountant. Her father supervises a warehouse. She has to half-sisters and a half-brother from her father’s previous relationships with three other women. Her parents have two other kids between them, so she also has two full brothers. Growing up was a difficult thing for Rihanna to do. She sold clothes on the street with her father, who was a known crack cocaine addict as well as an alcoholic. She suffered from intense headaches as a child so bad that doctors thought she had a tumor they could not find.</p><p>However, when Rihanna turned 14 and her parents decided to go their separate ways, she stayed with her mother and her headaches began to recede. She’d always had a great love affair with reggae music, but she also loved to be part of her army cadet program in school. She planned on pursuing other careers after graduating from high school, but she was given an opportunity to become a singer, and she took it never finishing her education. She and two friends formed a group and managed to get an audition with Evan Rogers, who decided Rihanna was the true star and the other two girls didn’t matter. He brought her to the states where she was given a chance to record an album over the course of the following year.</p><p>Once the demo was complete, it was sent out to different recording agencies and rapper Jay-Z picked up the music at Def Jam. At first he wasn’t sure, but then LA Reid said to keep her in the building until she was able to sign a contract and that’s what he did. She waited in his offices until 3 am until their lawyers could complete the contract so that she did not have time to leave the building and sign anywhere else. Her first song “Pon de Replay,” in 2005 and it was an instant hit. The rest, as they say, is history. She’s now released 8 studio albums in 11 years, won numerous awards and become one of the most famous faces in the music business.</p><p>Personally, Rihanna has had a lot of ups and downs. While she tends to keep her life as private as possible, she did have an instance when <a href=#>her then-boyfriend, Chris Brown</a>, physically assaulted her and was arrested. The two rekindled their romance nearly four years later for a short period of time, but she managed to date numerous other singers, athletes and stars in the meantime. She’s been linked with Canadian rapper Drake off and on for years, and he recently professed his love to her in 2016 during the MTV VMAs as he presented her with the biggest award of the night. She is one of the biggest names in the music industry right now, and she will not stop that until she’s good and ready.</p><p>Photo by Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGipoqCRo7uiec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
